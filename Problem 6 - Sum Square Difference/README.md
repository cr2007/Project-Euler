## Sum Square Difference

The sum of the *squares* of the first ten natural numbers is,

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\large 1^2%2B2^2%2B...%2B10^2 =385">

The **square** of the ***sum*** of the first ten natural numbers is,

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\large (1%2B2%2B...%2B10)^2 =55^2=3025">

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=3025-385=2640">.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
