## Pandigital Multiples

Take the number 192 and multiply it by each of 1, 2, and 3:

<blockquote> 
<div ><img style="background: white;" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=192*1%3D192"></div>
<div ><img style="background: white;" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=192*2%3D384"></div>
<div ><img style="background: white;" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=192*3%3D576"></div>
</blockquote>

By concatenating each product we get the 1 to 9 pandigital, 192384576.<br>
We will call 192384576 the **concatenated product** of 192 and (1,2,3)

The same can be achieved by starting with 9 and multiplying by 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, giving the pandigital, 918273645, which is the **concatenated product** of **9** and **(1,2,3,4,5)**.

What is the largest 1 to 9 pandigital 9-digit number that can be formed as the concatenated product of an integer with (1,2, ... , _n_) where _n_ > 1?
