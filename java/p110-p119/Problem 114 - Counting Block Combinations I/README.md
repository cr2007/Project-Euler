## Counting Block Combinations

A row measuring seven units in length has red blocks with a minimum length of three units placed on it, such that any two red blocks (which are allowed to be different lengths) are separated by at least one grey square.<br>
There are exactly seventeen ways of doing this.

</div>

How many ways can a row measuring fifty units in length be filled?

**NOTE:** Although the example above does not lend itself to the possibility, in general it is permitted to mix block sizes.<br>
For example, on a row measuring eight units in length you could use red (3), grey (1), and red (4).
