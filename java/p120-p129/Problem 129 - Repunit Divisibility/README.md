## Repunit Divisibility

A number consisting entirely of ones is called a **repunit**.<br>
We shall define R(<var>k</var>) to be a repunit of length <var>k</var>; for example, R(6) = 111111.

Given that <var>n</var> is a positive integer and GCD(<var>n</var>, 10) = 1, it can be shown that there always exists a value, k, for which R(k) is divisible by <var>n</var>,<br>
and let A(<var>n</var>) be the least such value of k; for example, A(7) = 6 and A(41) = 5.

The least value of <var>n</var> for which A(<var>n</var>) first exceeds ten is 17.

Find the least value of <var>n</var> for which A(<var>n</var>) first exceeds one-million.
