## Prime Cube partnership

There are some prime values, <var>p</var>, for which there exists a positive integer, <var>n</var>, such that the expression $n^3+n^2p$ is a **perfect cube** (cube of an integer).

For example, when $p=19$, $8^3+8^2 \times 19 = 12^3$.

What is perhaps most surprising is that for each prime with this property the value of <var>n</var> is unique, and there are only four such primes below one-hundred.

How many primes below one million have this remarkable property?
