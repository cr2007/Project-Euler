## Triangle Containment

Three distinct points are plotted at random on a Cartesian plane, for which -1000 ≤ <var>x</var>, <var>y</var> ≤ 1000, such that a triangle is formed.

Consider the following two triangles:

<div align="center">
	A(-340,495), B(-153,-910), C(835,-947)
	<br>
	<br>
	X(-175,41), Y(-421,-714), Z(574,-645)
</div>

It can be verified that triangle ABC contains the origin, whereas triangle XYZ does not.

Using [triangles.txt](p102_triangles.txt), a 27K text file containing the co-ordinates of one thousand "random" triangles, find the number of triangles for which the interior contains the origin.

##### NOTE: The first two examples in the [file](p102_triangles.txt) represent the triangles in the example given above.
