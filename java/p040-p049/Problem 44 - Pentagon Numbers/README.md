## Pentagon Numbers

Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula:

$$
P_n = \dfrac{n(3n-1)}{2}
$$

The firt ten pentagonal numbers are:
<div align="center">
    1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, ...
</div>
<br>
It can be seen that P<sub>4</sub> + P<sub>7</sub> = 22 + 70 = 92 = P<sub>8</sub><br>
However, their difference, 70 - 22 = 48, is not pentagonal.
<br>
<br>
Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, P<var><sub>j</sub></var> and P<var><sub>k</sub></var> , for which their sum, and difference are pentagonal and D = |P<var><sub>k</sub></var> - P<var><sub>j</sub></var> | is minimised;<br>
what is the value of D?
