## Goldbach's Other Conjecture

It was proprosed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.

<blockquote>
    9 = 7 + (2 × 1<sup>2</sup>)<br>
    15 = 7 + (2 × 2<sup>2</sup>)<br>
    21 = 3 + (2 × 3<sup>2</sup>)<br>
    25 = 7 + (2 × 3<sup>2</sup>)<br>
    27 = 19 + (2 × 2<sup>2</sup>)<br>
    33 = 31 + (2 × 1<sup>2</sup>)
</blockquote>

It turns out that the conjecture was false.

What is the smalled odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?
