## Amicable Numbers

Let d(_n_) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of _n_ (numbers less than _n_ which divide evenly into _n_).<br>
If d(_a_) = _b_ and d(_b_) = _a_, , where _a_ â‰  _b_, then _a_ and _b_ are an amicable pair and each of _a_ and _b_ are called **amicable numbers**.

For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.

Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.
