## Number Spiral Diagonals

Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

<div align="center">
<b>21</b> 22 23 24 <b>25</b><br>
20 <b>&nbsp;7</b>&nbsp; 8 <b>&nbsp; 9</b>&nbsp; 10<br>
19 &nbsp;6&nbsp; <b>1</b> <b>&nbsp; 2</b>&nbsp; 11<br>
18 <b>&nbsp;5</b>&nbsp; 4 <b>&nbsp; 3</b>&nbsp; 12<br>
<b>17</b> 16 15 14 <b>13</b>
</div>

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.

What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?
