## Spiral Primes

Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square spiral with sidelength 7 is formed.

<div align="center">
    <b>37</b> 36 35 34 33 32 <b>31</b><br>
    38 <b>17</b> 16 15 14 <b>13</b> 30<br>
    39 18 <b>05</b> 04 <b>03</b> 12 29<br>
    40 19 06 01 02 11 28<br>
    41 20 <b>07</b> 08 09 10 27<br>
    42 21 22 23 24 25 26<br>
    <b>43</b> 44 45 46 47 48 49
</div>

It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal,<br>
but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.

If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed.<br>
If this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?
