## Square Root Convergents

It is possible to show that the square root of two can be expressed as an infinite continued fraction.

$$
\sqrt{2} = 1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + ...}}}
$$

By expanding this for the first four iterations, we get:

$1 + \dfrac{1}{2} = \dfrac{3}{2} = 1.5$
<br>
<br>

$1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2}} = \dfrac{7}{5}= 1.4$
<br>
<br>

$1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2}}} = \dfrac{17}{12} = 1.41666...$
<br>
<br>

$1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2}}}} = \dfrac{41}{29} = 1.41379...$

The next three expansions are $\frac{99}{70}$, $\frac{239}{169}$, and $\frac{577}{408}$, but the eighth expansion, $\frac{1393}{985}$, is the first example where the first number of digits in the numerator exceeds the number of digits in the denominator.

In the first one-thousand expansions, how many fractions contain a numerator with more digits than the denominator?
