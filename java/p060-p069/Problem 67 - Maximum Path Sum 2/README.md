## Maximum Path Sum 2

By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.

<div align="center">
<b>3</b><br>
<b>7</b> 4<br>
2 <b>4</b> 6<br>
8 5 <b>9</b> 3
</div>

That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.

Find the maximum total from top to bottom in [triangle.txt](p067_triangle.txt), a 15K text file containing a triangle with one-hundred rows.

**NOTE:** This is a much more difficult version of [Problem 18](../../p010-p019/Problem%2018%20-%20Maximum%20Path%20Sum%201). It is not possible to try every route to solve this problem, as there are 2<sup>99</sup> altogether!<br>
If you could check one trillion (10<sup>12</sup>) routes every second, it would take over twenty billion years to check them all. There is an efficient algorithm to solve it. ;o)
