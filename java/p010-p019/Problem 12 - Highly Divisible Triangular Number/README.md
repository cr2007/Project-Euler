## Highly Divisible Triangular Number

The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

**1**: 1<br>
**3**: 1,3<br>
**6**: 1,2,3,6<br>
**10**: 1,2,5,10<br>
**15**: 1,3,5,15<br>
**21**: 1,3,7,21<br>
**28**: 1,2,4,7,14,28

We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?
