## Pandigital Prime Sets

Using all of the digits 1 through 9 and concatenating them freely to form decimal integers, different sets can be formed.<br>
Interestingly with the set $\{2, 5, 47, 89, 631\}$, all of the elements belonging to it are prime.

How many distinct sets containing each of the digits one through nine exactly once contain only prime elements?
