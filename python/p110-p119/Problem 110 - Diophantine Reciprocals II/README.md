## Diophantine Reciprocals II

In the following equation, <var>x</var>, <var>y</var>, and <var>n</var> are positive integers.

$$
\frac{1}{y} + \frac{1}{y} = \frac{1}{n}
$$

It can be verified that when $n=1260$, there are 113 distinct solutions and this is the least value for $n$ for which the total number of distinct solutions exceeds one hundred.

What is the least value of $n$ for which the number of distinct solutions exceeds four million?

#### NOTE: This problem is a much more difficult version of [Problem 108](../../p100-p109/Problem%20108%20-%20Diophantine%20Reciprocals%20I/) and as it is well beyong the limitations of a brute force approach it requires a clever implementation.
