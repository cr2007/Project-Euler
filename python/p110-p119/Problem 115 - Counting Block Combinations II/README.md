## Counting Block Combinations II

#### NOTE: This is a more difficult version of [Problem 114](../Problem%20114%20-%20Counting%20Block%20Combinations%20I/).

A row measuring <var>n</var> units in length has red blocks with a minimum length of <var>m</var> units placed on it, such that any two red blocks (which are allowed to be different lengths) are separated by at least one black square.

Let the fill-count function, F(<var>m</var>, <var>n</var>), represent the number of ways that a row can be filled.

For example, F(3, 29) = 673135 and F(3, 30) = 1089155.

That is, for <var>m</var> = 3, it can be seen that <var>n</var> = 30 is the smallest value for which the fill-count function first exceeds one million.

In the same way, for <var>m</var> = 10, it can be verified that F(10, 56) = 880711 and F(10, 57) = 1148904, so <var>n</var> = 57 is the least value for which the fill-count function first exceeds one million.

For <var>m</var> = 50, find the least value of <var>n</var> for which the fill-count function first exceeds one million.
