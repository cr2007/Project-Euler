## Integer Right Triangles

If _p_ is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {<var>a</var>, <var>b</var>, <var>c</var>}, there are exactly three solutions for <var>p</var> = 120.

{20, 48, 52}, {24, 45, 51}, {30, 40, 50}

For which value of <var>p</var> â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?
