## Prime Permutations

The arithmetic sequence, 1487, 4817, 8147, in which each of the terms increases by <u>3330</u>, is unusual in two ways:

<ol type="i" start="1">
    <li>Each of the three terms are prime</li>
    <li>each of the 4-digit numbers are permutations of one another</li>
</ol>

There are no arithmetic sequences made up of three 1-, 2-, or 3-digit primes, exhibiting this property, but there is one other 4-digit increasing sequence.

What 12-digit number do you form by concatenating the three terms in this sequence?
