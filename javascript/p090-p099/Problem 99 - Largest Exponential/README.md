## Largest Exponential

Comparing two numbers written in index form like 2<sup>11</sup> and 3<sup>7</sup> is not difficult, as any calculator would confirm that 2<sup>11</sup> = 2048 < 3<sup>7</sup> = 2187.

However, confirming that 632382<sup>518061</sup> > 519432<sup>525806</sup> would be much more difficult, as both numbers contain over three million digits.

Using [base_exp.txt](p099_base_exp.txt), a 22K text file containing one thousand lines with a base/exponent pair on each line, determine which line number has the greatest numerical value.

_NOTE: The first two lines in the file represent the numbers in the example given above._
