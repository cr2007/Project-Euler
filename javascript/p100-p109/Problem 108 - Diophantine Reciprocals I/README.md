## Diophantine Reciprocals I

In the following equation <var>x</var>, <var>y</var>, and <var>n</var> are positive integers.

$$
\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} = \frac{1}{n}
$$

For <var>n</var> = 4 there are exactly three distinct solutions:

$$
\frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{4}
$$

$$
\frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{1}{4}
$$

$$
\frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{4}
$$

What is the least value of <var>n</var> for which the number of distinct solutions exceeds one-thousand?
