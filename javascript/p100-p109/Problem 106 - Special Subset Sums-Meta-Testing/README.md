## Special Subset Sums: Meta-Testing

Let S(A) represent the sum of elements in set A of size <var>n</var>.<br>
We shall call it a special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets, B and C, the following properties are true:

1. S(B) â‰  S(C); that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.
2. If B contains more elements than C then S(B) > S(C).

For this problem we shall assume that a given set contains <var>n</var> strictly increasing elements and it already satisfies the second rule.

Surprisingly, out of the 25 possible subset pairs that can be obtained from a set for which <var>n</var> = 4, only 1 of these pairs need to be tested for equality (first rule). <br>
Similarly, when <var>n</var> = 7, only 70 out of the 966 subset pairs need to be tested.

For <var>n</var> = 12, how many of the 261625 subset pairs that can be obtained need to be tested for equality?

NOTE: This problem is related to [Problem 103](..%5CProblem%20103%20-%20Special%20Subset%20Sums-Optimum) and [Problem 105](..%5CProblem%20105%20-%20Special%20Subset%20Sums-Testing).
