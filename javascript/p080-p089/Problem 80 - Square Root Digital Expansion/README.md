## Square Root Digital Expansion

It is well known that if the square root of a natural number is not an integer, then it is irrational.<br>
The decimal expansion of such square roots is infinite without any repeating pattern at all.

The square root of two is 1.41421356237309504880..., and the <u>digital sum</u> of the <u>first one hundred decimal digits</u> is **475**.

For the first one hundred natural numbers, find the total of the digital sums of the first one hundred decimal digits for all the irrational square roots.
