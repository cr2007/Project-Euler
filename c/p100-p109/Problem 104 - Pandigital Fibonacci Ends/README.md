## Pandigital Fibonacci Ends

The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

<div align="center">
	F<sub><var>n</var></sub> = F<sub><var>n</var>−1</sub> + F<sub><var>n</var>−2</sub>, where F<sub>1</sub> = 1 and F<sub>2</sub> = 1.
</div>

It turns out that F<sub>541</sub>, which contains 113 digits, is the first Fibonacci number for which the last nine digits are 1-9 pandigital (contain all the digits 1 to 9, but not necessarily in order).<br>
And F<sub>2749</sub>, which contains 575 digits, is the first Fibonacci number for which the first nine digits are 1-9 pandigital.

Given that F<sub><var>k</var></sub> is the first Fibonacci number for which the first nine digits AND the last nine digits are 1-9 pandigital, find <var>k</var>.
