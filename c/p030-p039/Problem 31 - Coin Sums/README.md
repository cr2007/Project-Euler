## Coin Sums

In the United Kingdom the currency is made up of pound (£) and pence (p). There are eight coins in general circulation:

<blockquote>
1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p), and £2 (200p).
</blockquote>

It is possible to make £2 in the following way:

<blockquote>
(1 × £1) + (1 × 50p) + (2 × 20p) + (1 × 5p) + (1 × 2p) + (3 × 1p)
</blockquote>

How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?
